Here we are in 2017. The new blog is up and ready using several open source tools. Jekyll, Github, Travis-CI, Cloudflare and Amazon S3 Buckets. Seeing how all these different tools work together is exciting. 

Thanks goes out to [Hugo Tunius - the-one-cent-blog post]("https://hugotunius.se/2016/01/10/the-one-cent-blog.html")

Look out for new posts on my recent projects:

Amazon Echo Websocket Project
Arduino GPRS Guatemala Sensor project.
Wemos (esp8266) LiPo Temp sensor Project.
Custom Micro Drone build out.

Happy 2017!
